    <main>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms are the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science applications. They enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
        <p>There are various types of machine learning algorithms, each suited for different tasks and datasets. Some common machine learning algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Logistic Regression</li>
            <li>Decision Trees</li>
            <li>Random Forests</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
            <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
            <li>Naive Bayes</li>
            <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
            <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
            <li>Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the problem domain, and the desired outcome.</p>
        <p>In this comprehensive guide, we will explore each machine learning algorithm in detail, including its principles, applications, advantages, and limitations. By understanding the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms, you will be better equipped to build predictive models and extract valuable insights from your data.</p>
