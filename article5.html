        How does the Respiratory System Work?
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The respiratory system plays a vital role in the human body, facilitating the exchange of gases necessary for cellular function and overall survival. Its primary function is to deliver oxygen to the body's tissues while removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism.

            The process of respiration begins with inhalation, during which air is drawn into the lungs through the nose and mouth. As air travels through the respiratory tract, it passes through the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchial tubes before reaching the alveoli, tiny air sacs within the lungs.
            
            In the alveoli, oxygen diffuses from the air into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells for transport to tissues throughout the body. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cellular metabolism, diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli to be exhaled from the body during exhalation.
            
            Exhalation completes the respiratory cycle, expelling carbon dioxide-rich air from the lungs and preparing the body for the next inhalation. The process of respiration is regulated by the respiratory center in the brainstem, which monitors oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream and adjusts breathing rate and depth accordingly.
            
            Overall, the respiratory system ensures the continuous supply of oxygen to cells for energy production and the removal of carbon dioxide to maintain acid-base balance and respiratory homeostasis.</p>
