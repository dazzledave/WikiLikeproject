        How does a battery work?
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>A battery works by converting chemical energy into electrical energy through a series of electrochemical reactions. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

            Inside the battery:
            
            Electrodes: The battery has two electrodes, an anode (negative) and a cathode (positive). These are typically made from different metals or metal compounds.
            Electrolyte: Between the electrodes lies a substance called the electrolyte. This is a solution or paste that allows ions (charged atoms or molecules) to move freely but prevents direct contact between the electrodes.
            Chemical reactions: During discharging:
            Oxidation: At the anode, atoms lose electrons and become positively charged ions. This releases energy and creates an electron flow.
            Reduction: At the cathode, ions gain electrons and become neutral atoms. This consumes energy.
            Ion flow: Ions in the electrolyte move to balance the electron flow, completing the circuit.
            External circuit: Electrons flow from the negative anode through an external circuit (e.g., a wire) to the positive cathode, powering devices.
            Charging the battery:
            
            Reverse the process: By applying an external voltage, the reactions are reversed.
            Electrons flow: Electrons are forced back into the anode, and ions move in the opposite direction.
            Chemical energy storage: Chemical energy is stored in the electrodes and electrolyte, ready for later use.
            Different types of batteries:
            
            Rechargeable batteries: Can be charged and discharged multiple times (e.g., lithium-ion).
            Non-rechargeable batteries: Can only be discharged once (e.g., alkaline).
            Remember: Different battery types use different materials and reactions, but the basic principles of converting chemical energy to electrical energy remain the same.
